# Instructions

- Run `jekyll serve` in project folder with Terminal and open `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to see the result of your changes. Jekyll will automatically regenerate project (in *_site* folder) on save if you make edits.

- For a convenient live reload of localhost on save use `jekyll serve --livereload`.

- New posts belong in designated folder in *content* directory.

- New folders in *content* directory must be declared in *_config.yml* under *collections* to be included in output.
