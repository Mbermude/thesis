## What is this project about?

In this project I want to find ways to create bridges between Cultures, in my case between the countries Mexico, Ghana and Germany. To achieve this I have three areas I want to work on:

**1. Instagram :** Through my account on instagram I want to share experiences during my stay in Ghana or also as a halfmexican - halfgerman in Germany. Topics would be : missunderstandings, Ahaa!-moments, learnings, funny moments.

**2. Workshops / Videos :** One obvious kind of „bridges“ between these cultures is food. I want to create 2 to 3 Workshops or videos in which I show receipes, cooking tools,
 ingredients and how to use them.

**3. Website :** In the end I want to create a website on which all these areas can be discovered. It should involve a communication platform where people can create workshops, cooking courses, cultural partys, etc. It is meant for everybody who wants to explore cultures.
