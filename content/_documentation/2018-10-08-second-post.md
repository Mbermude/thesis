 Last thursday I attended the open cooking event of "Über den Tellerrand". This association was founded 2013 in Berlin to help integrate refugees into our society. The selling of cooking books and cooking courses finances this great idea.

 I was amazed seeing so many people coming together just to cook, chat and have fun. All together we were about 40 people in the big kitchen area of the Volkshochschule in Munich.
 This time indonesian food was on the menu and I helped with cutting the curcumbers and frying some rolls which I still don't know what they were actually called. After 3 hours of cooking, watching, chatting and getting to know new people we finally enjoyed the menu.
