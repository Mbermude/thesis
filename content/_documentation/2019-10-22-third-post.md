When I was old enough to hold a knife my mum thaught me how to prepare an original guacamole. She learned it from my granny and I was very proud to finally get to know the secrets behind this delicious meal. And because I think it would be a crime to hold it back, here is the recipe :

Ingredients:

2 Avocados
a sip of Milk
1/2 Onion
4 cocktail tomatoes
1/2 Jalapeño
a bunch of Cilantro
1/2 lemon
Salt

1. Divide the avocados in the middle and remove the seed. Put the flesh inside a bowl. TIPP : Hit the seed with a sharp knife and turn it to easily remove it.
2. Add the milk to the avocado and mash all until it is mixed well.
3. Cut the tomatoes, onion, jalapeño and cilantro very fine and add to the mixture.
4. Add the salt and lemon. Mix everything.
5. In the end add the seeds to avoid the guacamole from becoming brown. 
6. Enjoy!!! :)
