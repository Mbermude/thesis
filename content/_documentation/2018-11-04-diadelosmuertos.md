**Instagram-Post**

Since last week the world celebrated Halloween, I thought it is a good moment to share the celebration of the day of the death in Mexico. With a little illustration I want to give a little overview about the altar which is let me say in the center of the ceremony. On this altar you can see some offers the familys prepare for their deceased family members.

**Research on Users...** 

To achieve a good result the most important part of course is a good research. Therefore I prepared 4 ficitve personas which should be the base for an interview with real people.

**...and Social Community Platforms**

Following websites are connecting people in different ways. One is about food, another one about travel or meeting for a specific reason. Some of the options offered there would be interesting to use for an intercultural website.
