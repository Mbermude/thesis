**Concept**


This week I concentrated more on how the User Journey could take place. In this User Journey the person desires to learn new recipes, social contact and/or cultural exchange. After visiting the Website he has the choice to  choose between Events close by which are displayed either on a map or directly as a suggestion. He clicks one of the suggested events and consequently sees a page with details to that event like Name, Time, Location etc. He likes the description and clicks on the „Join“ Button. In the 7th Step you can see him and the group enjoying eating together while chatting and having a nice time. Another thought was to create a place on the Eventsite where the owner can upload a picture of the food they cooked afterwards.

**Fufu Workshop Preparation** 

In the second part of this week I went for shopping to get all the ingredients for my Fufu Party on Sunday. For most of the ingredients like the Cassava Roots or the Plantain I needed to go to asian or african shops as they are not part of common food here.
On the following picture you can see from up to down the cassava root, the unripe plantain, tomatoe paste, maggi cube and vegetables.
