**Pro and Con Comparison Websites**

This week I took a closer look on the websites I chose as base for my platform. I concentrated on writing down the positive but also negative experiences I got when visiting these sites, which I can later refer to when I create my own concept :

![Ueberdentellerrand]({{'/assets/img/5c.jpg' | relative_url}})  
![Ueberdentellerrand]({{'/assets/img/5d.jpg' | relative_url}})
![Workaway]({{'/assets/img/5e.jpg' | relative_url}})  
![Workaway]({{'/assets/img/5f.jpg' | relative_url}})
![Couchsurfing]({{'/assets/img/5g.jpg' | relative_url}})  
![Couchsurfing]({{'/assets/img/5h.jpg' | relative_url}})


**Define the content for the Platform** 

By going through website concepts and talking to people more and more ideas came to my mind. Especially about possibilities the platform should offer the user later. With the following overview I tried to structure these thoughts about what content would be interesting to have.
