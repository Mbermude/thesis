**Social Structure**


In the beginning of this project I had a Website in mind as my end result. While working on my concept I realized that more intresting than a beautiful website later is rather the way how we construct social structure. How do we grow a social community from 0? During the Fufu Party I was looking on how this event was taking place:

**1. How and why do these people come together?**

**2. What happens during the food preparation?**

**3. What is the result of this social event?**


 1. How do people come together?

For my first cooking session I decided to simply invite friends through a facebook event. At the same time I talked to several people through phone and email. During the interviews I made earlier I always had the challenge in mind people face when going to meet a group of people not knowing any of them. Therefore I decided to push my friends to invite other friends as well, which worked so well.
The fear of being a stranger in a group only occurs when you dont have any conncetion to the people but becomes easier when you know at least one person.

 2. Why do people come together?

The main reasons for people coming together is mostly through invitations, friendships and in my case because of curiosity and the act of eating together.
