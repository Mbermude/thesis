Be careful how you greet! 🇬🇭 One of the first days after I arrived in Ghana I decided to take a walk through the village in which I was going to stay for the next year. It didn‘t take long until people saw the white girl walking around. 🚶🏻‍♀️And of course the most curious ones were the children! 👦🏾👧🏾 So I started greeting them in the normal way I used to greet people from far. But suddenly all these kids started coming towards me and after a few seconds I was surrounded by a little crowd of children all with expectations written into their faces. 👦🏾👧🏾🙍🏻‍♀️👦🏾👦🏾 They seemed to be waiting for something and I was just totally overwhelmed with that situation. Later I got to know that the movement I made was a gesture to say ‚Bra!‘. Thats the ghanaian language Twi and means translated ,Come!‘. In ghana this is a normal gesture which is used to ask people to come closer. From that experience on I only greeted by waving my hand instead of closing and opening it! 👋🏽🙂
