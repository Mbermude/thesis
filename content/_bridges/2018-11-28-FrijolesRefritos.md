One of the recipes I learned as a child. These fried beans are like the guacamole a side dish you can find almost everywhere on the menu in Mexico. It is super easy to prepare. Here is the recipe :

**Ingredients**

Pinto beans   
1 Onion  
Olive Oil  
Salt  

**Preparation**

1. Remove bad beans before you put all into a pot with three times the amount of water. Cover and allow the beans to suck the water over night.
2. Put the pot on the oven and allow the beans to cook until they are very soft.
3. In the meantime cut the onion into small cubes.
4. When the beans are ready take a pan and heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Fry a part of the onions and add a part of the beans together with the water in which they were cooking. Allow the beans to fry  2-3 Minutes together with the onions and then start to mash them until very soft.
5. Remove the mashed beans and put them aside. Repeat this process until all beans and onions are finished.
6. Serve this side dish with Tacos, meat or anything you like.
