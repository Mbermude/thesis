The day of the dead is not like Halloween a day of darkness and scary moments. It is a joyful day in which the mexicans celebrate life and death. 💃🏻🕺🏻🏵 The celebration starts at the 31st of October and ends on the 2nd of November. With beautiful decorated altars „ofrendas“ the familys invite the deceased members to come and celebrate with them. Typically you can find the colorful skulls „calaveras“ 💀, a special bread 🍞„pan de muerto“, candles 🕯 and pictures of the person on the altar, as well as the typical orange flower marigold 🌼.
